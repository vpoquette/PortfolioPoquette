  This was my final project for the Software Design course; one of the options was to create a program which implemented 5 features from a list. <br>
</p>

<p>The features I chose were: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintain the single responsibility principle by having multiple classes that each do only one thing</li>
    <li>Use at least one interface in your project design</li>
    <li>Use the decorator pattern to extend a class</li>
    <li>Implement multiple web pages or Windows forms</li>
    <li>Present your work-in-progress at the CIS Showcase</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  I decided to create a simulator of walking through Tower Hall (where I have had all but one of my in-person classes) as classes are in session. <br>
  Each page represents a floor of the building; when you click on the tab for a floor in the navigation bar, <br>
  &nbsp;the page calls a method to generate random text from an array. <br>
  The unique rooms on each floor have their own classes, while the classrooms share four classes, <br>
  &nbsp;since all of them do the same thing for the sake of simplicity. <br>
  Each classroom generates an activity, the student attendance expressed as a percentage, <br>
  &nbsp;an analogy the professor uses during the lecture, and the students' general reaction to that analogy.
</p>
<p>
  It was difficult for me to figure out how to call the methods from the .cs files into the .cshtml file, <br>
  &nbsp; since I had never worked with C# before this class.

<p>
  The web pages were setup in the Model-View-Controller format:

  Since I was following the single-responsibility principle, I had a number of classes:
