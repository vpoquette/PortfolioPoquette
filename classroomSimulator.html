  This was my final project for the Software Design course; one of the options was to create a program which implemented 5 features from a list. <br>
  The features I chose were: <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintain the single responsibility principle by having multiple classes that each do only one thing</li>
    <li>Use at least one interface in your project design</li>
    <li>Use the decorator pattern to extend a class</li>
    <li>Implement multiple web pages or Windows forms</li>
    <li>Present your work-in-progress at the CIS Showcase</li>
  </ul>
  I decided to create a simulator of walking through Tower Hall (where I have had all but one of my in-person classes) as classes are in session. <br>
  Each page represents a floor of the building; when you click on the tab for a floor in the navigation bar, <br>
  the page calls a method to generate random text from an array. <br>
  The unique rooms on each floor have their own classes, while the classrooms share four classes, <br>
  since all of them do the same thing for the sake of simplicity. <br>
  Each classroom generates an activity, the student attendance expressed as a percentage, <br>
  an analogy the professor uses during the lecture, and the students' general reaction to that analogy.
