    This project came in two parts; the first part was to generate the board, and the second part was to make it interactive. <br>
    The board was generated using a tree structure. The board itself was the parent, and each smaller section was a descendant.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    A randomly generated board:

<p>
    Players could click on the board to highlight a block, then use the up arrow key to select its parent:

<img src="blockyPics/highlight2.png" height="640" width="670px" class="center">
<p>
    Using the H key, players could swap the children of a block horizontally:

<p>
  Using the V key, players could swap the children of a block vertically:

<img src="blockyPics/swapVertical.png" height="640" width="670px" class="center">
<p>
  Using the left arrow key, players could rotate the children of a block counterclockwise:
</p>
<img src="blockyPics/preRotate.png" height="640" width="670px" class="center">
<img src="blockyPics/rotateLeft.png" height="640" width="670px" class="center">
<p>
  Using the right arrow key, players could rotate the children of a block clockwise:
</p>
<img src="blockyPics/preRotate.png" height="640" width="670px" class="center">
<img src="blockyPics/rotateRight.png" height="640" width="670px" class="center">
<p>
  Using the spacebar or S key, players could smash a block to generate new children for it:
